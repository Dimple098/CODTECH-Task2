Overview of the project

Project: GOOGLE ANALYTICS SETUP AND REPORTING

Objective:

This report documents the implementation of Google Analytics 4 (GA4) on the Google Merchandise Store website. 
The purpose of this implementation is to track user behavior, generate detailed reports, and derive data-driven recommendations
to optimize the website and digital marketing strategies.

Google Analytics Setup:

Google Analytics 4 property "Google Merchandise Store (web data)" was created for the website. 
The tracking code provided by GA4 was implemented on all pages of the website to start collecting data.

Configuration:

- Events and parameters were defined to track key user interactions such as pageviews, clicks, and conversions.
- Enhanced measurement was enabled to automatically track common user interactions like page scrolls and outbound clicks.
- User properties were configured to track user demographics and interests, providing insights into the audience.

Custom Reports and Dashboards:

Custom reports and dashboards were created to monitor key metrics:
Engagement Dashboard: Provides an overview of user engagement metrics including session duration, bounce rate, and average pages per session.
Conversion Report: Tracks conversion events such as purchases and form submissions to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
Traffic Sources Report: Analyzes the sources of website traffic (e.g., organic search, direct, referral) to identify the most effective channels for driving traffic.

Analysis and Recommendations:

- Popular Pages: Analysis reveals that the "Featured Products" page receives the highest traffic, suggesting its importance in the user journey.
  Recommendation: Optimize this page for conversions by highlighting top-selling products.
- User Engagement: The average session duration is relatively low, indicating a need to improve website engagement. 
  Recommendation: Enhance website content and user experience to increase engagement and reduce bounce rates.
- Marketing Campaign Effectiveness: Analysis of conversion events attributed to different marketing campaigns shows that email marketing drives the highest conversions. 
  Recommendation: Allocate more resources to email marketing campaigns to maximize ROI.
